**Affiliation:** CNRS / École Normale Supérieure – Institut de Biologie de l’ENS (IBENS), Département de Génomique Fonctionnelle  
**Period:** 2008–2012  
**Supervision:** Philippe Bensaude, CNRS UMR 8197  
**Thesis Title:** *Régulation du facteur d’élongation transcriptionnelle P-TEFb par les protéines HEXIM1 et TAT du VIH-1*

## 🧭 Context
The P-TEFb complex (Cyclin T1/CDK9) is a central regulator of RNA polymerase II transcriptional elongation.  
Its activity is controlled by the **7SK RNP complex**, where **HEXIM1** acts as an inhibitory subunit, and hijacked by the **HIV-1 Tat** protein to promote viral gene expression.  

This thesis investigated the structural and functional interfaces involved in these interactions to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional control.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Map the protein–protein interaction surfaces within the P-TEFb complex.  
- Characterize how HEXIM1 and HIV-1 Tat compete for Cyclin T1 binding.  
- Explore the impact of these interactions on transcriptional regulation in mammalian and model systems.

## Project Overview

This research project focused on the **structural and functional dissection of P-TEFb regulation**, combining:

* **High-throughput yeast genetics (reverse two-hybrid)**

* **Fluorescence microscopy (localization, FLIP, single-molecule tracking)**
* **Biochemical assays (co-IP, CTD kinase assays)**
* **RNA level analyses (7SK detection, phylogeny, structural modeling)**
* **Comparative genomics and evolutionary reconstruction of 7SK RNA and its protein partners**

The core objective was to **map the interaction surfaces between Cyclin T1 (CycT1), CDK9, HEXIM1, LARP7**, and the **7SK snRNA**, and to understand how this regulatory module evolved across Metazoa.

## 🧪 Methods
- **Molecular biology:** Cloning, plasmid construction, and mutagenesis (site-directed PCR).  
- **Cell biology:** Establishment of stable transgenic cell lines and *C. elegans* models expressing labeled constructs.  
- **Protein analysis:** Co-immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and two-hybrid screening (yeast).  
- **Microscopy:** Confocal imaging, FRET / FRAP / FLIP assays to measure protein dynamics.  
- **Biochemical assays:** RNA/DNA/protein extraction, immunodetection, quantitative analysis of transcriptional complexes.

* **High-throughput yeast genetics (reverse two-hybrid)**
* **Mutagenesis of Cyclin T1 and HEXIM1**
* **Cell-based assays in human and mouse cells**

## **2. Biological Background**

### **2.1 P-TEFb (CDK9/Cyclin T)**

P-TEFb is the central transcription elongation factor that phosphorylates:

* **NELF, DSIF** (pausing release)
* **RNAPII CTD** (productive elongation)
* **RNA processing factors**

### **2.2 Inhibition by HEXIM1/7SK snRNA**

In cells, most P-TEFb is kept inactive by:

* **HEXIM1** bound to
* **7SK snRNA** assembled with **LARP7** and **MePCE**.

HEXIM1 and HIV-1 Tat compete for a **partially overlapping binding surface on Cyclin T1**.

### **2.3 Viral hijacking**

HIV-1 Tat binds the same groove of Cyclin T1 and recruits P-TEFb onto TAR RNA, strongly activating transcription.

## **3. Experimental Strategy**

### **3.1 Large-scale random mutagenesis of Cyclin T1**

* **Error-prone PCR** of defined CycT1 subdomains
* **Recombination in yeast** to rebuild full-length BD-CycT1
* **Reverse two-hybrid selection** on 5-FOA
* Identification of **single amino-acid substitutions disrupting HEXIM1 interaction**

### **3.2 Targeted mutagenesis of HEXIM1**

* Alanine scanning of conserved motifs (basic region, PYNT motif, dimerization helix)
* Identification of **key aromatic residues** essential for Cyclin-binding (F262, F267, H275)

### **3.3 Two-hybrid validation pipeline**

* HEXIM1 interaction
* CDK9 binding control
* Mutant selection based on **Hexim(–) / Cdk9(++)** profiles

### **3.4 Cell-based validation**

* **Co-immunoprecipitation** (CycT1 mutants + endogenous HEXIM1 or CDK9)
* **CTD kinase assays** with/without RNAse
* **Reporter assays** (Gal4-CycT1 to recruit P-TEFb)
* **HIV Tat rescue assays in mouse 3T3 cells**

## **4. Key Results**

### **4.1 Mapping the P-TEFb–HEXIM1 binding interface**

* Mutations disrupting HEXIM1 binding cluster along a **groove between the two cyclin folds**.
* The **central hotspot is residue Y175** of Cyclin T1.
* Y175 establishes a **π-hydrogen bond network** bridging helices H1–H2/H1’–H2’.

### **4.2 Overlap with HIV Tat binding**

* Y175 mutants **cannot bind Tat**
* → cannot support Tat-mediated HIV LTR activation
* → cannot bind TAR RNA
* → do not recruit P-TEFb to HIV promoter

### **4.3 HEXIM1 structural determinants**

* Three conserved aromatic residues (F262, F267, H275) are **essential for Cyclin T1 docking**.
* They occur in an **intrinsically disordered region**, similar to regions in other CDK regulators (p21, p27).

### **4.4 Cellular phenotypes**

* CycT1-Y175 mutants show:

  * Loss of HEXIM1 binding
  * Normal CDK9 binding
  * Increased CTD-kinase activity (insensitive to 7SK/HEXIM repression)
  * Enhanced transcription activation when tethered to DNA

### **4.5 Single-molecule mobility**

* C-terminal truncations of CycT affect:

  * RNAPII association
  * Nuclear mobility (measured by FLIP and photoactivation)

### **4.6 Evolutionary findings (MBE 2009)**

* 7SK/HEXIM system present across most Metazoa.
* **Two alternative structural conformations** of 7SK M2 region → potential RNA switch.
* Discovery and experimental validation of **functional 7SK homolog in C. elegans**.
* HEXIM and LARP7 underwent **lineage-specific duplications and losses** (HEXIM1/2 in mammals).
