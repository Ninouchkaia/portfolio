## 🧭 Context
The P-TEFb complex (Cyclin T1/CDK9) is a central regulator of RNA polymerase II transcriptional elongation.  
Its activity is controlled by the **7SK RNP complex**, where **HEXIM1** acts as an inhibitory subunit, and hijacked by the **HIV-1 Tat** protein to promote viral gene expression.  

This thesis investigated the structural and functional interfaces involved in these interactions to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of transcriptional control.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Map the protein–protein interaction surfaces within the P-TEFb complex.  
- Characterize how HEXIM1 and HIV-1 Tat compete for Cyclin T1 binding.  
- Explore the impact of these interactions on transcriptional regulation in mammalian and model systems.  

---

## 🧪 Methods
- **Molecular biology:** Cloning, plasmid construction, and mutagenesis (site-directed PCR).  
- **Cell biology:** Establishment of stable transgenic cell lines and *C. elegans* models expressing labeled constructs.  
- **Protein analysis:** Co-immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and two-hybrid screening (yeast).  
- **Microscopy:** Confocal imaging, FRET / FRAP / FLIP assays to measure protein dynamics.  
- **Biochemical assays:** RNA/DNA/protein extraction, immunodetection, quantitative analysis of transcriptional complexes.

## 💡 Contributions
- Constructed mutant libraries of Cyclin T1 and HEXIM1 to identify contact regions with P-TEFb and Tat.  
- Mapped functional domains responsible for transcriptional activation or inhibition.  
- Combined biochemical and imaging approaches to establish a structure–function model of P-TEFb regulation.  
- Contributed to internal publications and collaborative manuscripts within the Bensaude group.
