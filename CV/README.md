# **Portfolio - Research, Bioinformatics & Computational Biology**

This repository gathers a selection of scientific, technical and software-engineering projects developed during my PhD, postdocs (CNRS, CONICET, INSERM), and industry experience (Airbus/Capgemini). It showcases **biological modeling**, **multi-omics analysis**, **network science**, **data collection and analysis pipelines** and **reproducible workflows** in Python, R, Snakemake, NetLogo and OpenMOLE.
