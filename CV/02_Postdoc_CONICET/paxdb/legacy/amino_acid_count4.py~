#update from version2
# we avoid to open twice the fasta file and find the matched uniprot id only once
# in order to reach the end of the script more rapidly (originally it took 1350 seconds for the 17 datasets > with this script : 1130 seconds)

#description of the original version
# this script reads a fasta file of proteins and counts the amino acid occurences in each protein.
# this script also reads a dataset of protein abundance data. The abundance datasets are mainly composed of 2 columns : string ID - abundance score
# this script matches the string IDs to uniprot IDs through the use of a mapping file generated with the id mapping tool from uniprot.org.
# it creates different files that serve to make a final file containing the uniprot id names of the proteins, their abundance (cf. pax-db databse), and the counts of amino acids for each protein.
# it has to be executed where the final files will be saved
#
