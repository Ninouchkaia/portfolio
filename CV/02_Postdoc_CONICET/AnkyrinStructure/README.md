## Context
Ankyrin repeat proteins are one of the most common structural motifs in nature, characterized by tandem repeats of ~33 amino acids forming curved solenoid architectures. Their modularity and folding cooperativity make them a powerful model for studying **protein stability, folding dynamics**, and **evolutionary constraints**. This project investigated how local energetic properties and sequence variations contribute to the stability and function of ankyrin repeat proteins.

## Objectives
- Compare computational methods for identifying and annotating ankyrin repeats in protein structures.  
- Characterize energetic profiles and folding patterns across repeat regions.  
- Explore how local geometry and sequence composition affect structural stability.  

---

## Methods
- **Dataset construction:** Collection of structural ankyrin proteins from the Protein Data Bank (PDB).  
- **Repeat detection:** Comparison of three annotation strategies:
  1. Pfam generic HMM,  
  2. HMM derived from structural alignment,  
  3. Three region-specific HMMs (N-terminal, central, C-terminal repeats).  
- **Structural analysis:** 3D alignments of repeat regions and geometric quantification of curvature and packing.  
- **Energetic modeling:** Application of a **protein tessellation method** to map local stability/instability zones.  
- **Visualization:** PyMOL and in-house scripts for energy profiles and structural mapping.
