## Context
Ankyrin repeat proteins are versatile scaffolds that mediate protein–protein interactions through repeated structural units.  
This project explored how **linear motifs (SLiMs)** located in **disordered regions** cooperate with **structured ankyrin domains** to form functional modules and define interaction specificity.

The study aimed to delineate **domain–motif–function associations** using integrated bioinformatic analyses.

## Objectives
- Identify conserved **short linear motifs (SLiMs)** in disordered regions of ankyrin proteins and their partners.  
- Quantify **evolutionary conservation** of these motifs to distinguish functional versus random occurrences.  
- Establish functional links between repeated domains, motifs, and biological processes.

## Methods
- **Data retrieval:** Automated sequence collection using APIs and web scraping from **UniProt**, **SMART**, and **PDB**.  
- **Annotation:** Parsing and cross-annotation with Pfam, ELM, and STRING databases.  
- **Motif detection:** Regular expression–based search for SLiMs within predicted disordered regions.  
- **Alignment and conservation:** Multiple sequence alignment (HMMER, CD-HIT, BLASTp) and evolutionary conservation scoring.  
- **Functional enrichment:** Overrepresentation tests linking modules to GO terms and biological pathways.  
- **Visualization:** Custom scripts (Python/R) for heatmaps, network graphs, and module mapping.

## Contributions
- Designed and implemented a full **bioinformatic pipeline** (Python, Bash) for sequence retrieval, parsing, and annotation.  
- Identified recurrent domain–motif associations across ankyrin-containing proteins.  
- Performed statistical enrichment analyses linking modules to apoptosis, nuclear transport, and lipid modification.  
- Produced visualizations and presented findings at international conferences (ISMB, ESCS).
