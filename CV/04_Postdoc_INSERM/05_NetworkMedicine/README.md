**Period:** 2020–2021  
**Publication:** [Network and Systems Medicine, 2020](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/nsm.2020.0011)


## Context
At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, identifying potential therapeutic candidates required integrative strategies beyond single-target screening. This project used **network medicine** approaches to explore interactions between SARS-CoV-2 proteins, host cellular pathways, and drug targets, with the goal of repositioning existing compounds.  


## Objectives
- Integrate multi-omics and molecular interaction data to construct a **virus–host–drug network**.  
- Identify biologically plausible drug candidates through **topological proximity** and **pathway enrichment**.  
- Test robustness of network-based predictions using simulated perturbations.  


## Methods
- **Data integration:** Host–virus interactome from public datasets (BioGRID, IntAct), drug–target relationships from DrugBank and ChEMBL.  
- **Network modeling:** Weighted graph representation of molecular associations.  
- **Simulation:** Random rewiring and node removal to assess prediction stability.  
- **Analysis:** Centrality and community detection to highlight key druggable modules.  
- **Validation:** Cross-checking candidate lists with published clinical data and ongoing trials.  

## Contributions
- Implemented random network simulations to evaluate robustness of predicted drug–disease associations.  
- Automated analysis of node connectivity and topological metrics for ranking candidate drugs.  
- Contributed to visualization and reporting of systemic network perturbations.  
- Participated in manuscript review and interpretation of results.
