## Context
Cancer cell populations exhibit remarkable adaptability to treatment, with specific subclones surviving therapeutic pressure and driving relapse.  
This project aimed to trace the **evolutionary trajectories of tumor cell clones** using **barcoding** and **single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)** data, in order to identify molecular features associated with treatment resistance and clonal persistence.

---

## Objectives
- Characterize clonal composition and dynamics during treatment exposure.  
- Identify transcriptomic signatures of resistant or dormant cell populations.  
- Model the emergence and selection of adaptive phenotypes.  

---

## Methods
- **Data:** scRNA-seq and barcode lineage tracking datasets from treated tumor models.  
- **Preprocessing:** Cell quality filtering, normalization, and clustering (Seurat / Scanpy).  
- **Clonal mapping:** Barcode assignment and integration with transcriptomic clusters.  
- **Differential analysis:** Comparison of gene expression profiles between surviving vs. depleted clones.  
- **Visualization:** UMAP, pseudotime trajectories, and clonal abundance dynamics.

## Contributions
- Processed and analyzed single-cell RNA-seq datasets integrating lineage barcoding information.  
- Identified gene expression programs linked to treatment resistance and clonal persistence.  
- Collaborated on the interpretation of pseudotemporal differentiation patterns.  
- Prepared internal visual summaries and figures for collaborative reporting.
