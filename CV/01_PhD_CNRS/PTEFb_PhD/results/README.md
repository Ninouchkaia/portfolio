# Key Results (Experimental)

- Identification of Cyclin T1 hotspot Y175 required for HEXIM1/Tat binding  
- Mutants that retain CDK9 binding but lose HEXIM1 regulation  
- Hyperactive P-TEFb variants insensitive to 7SK inhibition  
- Luciferase-based functional readouts for mutant CycT1 alleles  
- CTD kinase activity shifts associated with regulatory interactions  
- Nuclear mobility changes visualized by Dendra-CycT1 imaging
