# **Nina Verstraete - Scientific Portfolio**

This repository serves as the entry point to my scientific and computational work in:

* computational biology & structural bioinformatics
* large-scale data processing and analysis
* pipeline design and refactoring
* scientific modelling 
* reproducible codebases

It is organized into two sections: my **CV** and a selection of **computational projects** that represent my experience.

---

## **1. CV - Scientific Background & Research Experience**

See folder here: [CV](CV)

This folder contains a curated overview of my scientific career, including:

* Research experience (computational biology, structural bioinformatics, multi-omics analysis, agent-based modelling)
* Postdoctoral and PhD
* Selected publications
* Scientific summaries used in job applications and dossiers
* Figure excerpts and high-level project descriptions

This section provides **context**, **trajectory**, and **scope** for the computational projects showcased below.

## **2. Bioinfo_projects - Featured Computational Biology Pipelines**

See folder: [bioinfo_projects](bioinfo_projects).

This directory highlights **six major projects**, presented as an independent module with its own README, analysis pipeline, figures, and code.

### **Included projects**

* [Bulk RNA-seq Deconvolution](CV/04_Postdoc_INSERM/03_RNASeqDeconvolution)
Snakemake pipeline + R scripts + QC + tumour microenvironment predictions.  

* [Barcode Clonal Dynamics](CV/04_Postdoc_INSERM/07_BarcodesDrugScreening)
High-throughput barcode counts → QC → DESeq2 → drug network correlation.  

* [COVID-19 Network Medicine Pipeline](CV/04_Postdoc_INSERM/05_NetworkMedicine)
Multilayer graphs, mock networks, Z-scores, ranking of proteins, GO terms, drugs.  

* [Agent-Based Tumour Model Analysis Suite](CV/04_Postdoc_INSERM/01_AgentBasedModel)
Python package orchestrating NetLogo/OpenMOLE simulations, validation, sensitivity.  

* [Amino-Acid Usage Evolution with PaxDB](CV/02_Postdoc_CONICET/paxdb)
Python toolkit for FASTA parsing, abundance loading, AA metrics and correlations.  

* [Ankyrin Modularity (PFAM/ELM)](CV/02_Postdoc_CONICET/ANKYRIN_MODULARITY)
Compositional modularity analysis with enrichment and conservation pipelines.
