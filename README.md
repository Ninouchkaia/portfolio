# Nina Verstraete — Computational Biologist & Bioinformatics Researcher  

Welcome!  
I am a multidisciplinary researcher at the crossroads of **molecular biology**, **bioinformatics**, and **computational modeling**.  
My work bridges experimental biology, data science, and digital modeling to explore the complexity of biological systems — from protein evolution to tumor–immune dynamics.

## 🔍 Overview

This GitHub repository documents the **methods**, **projects**, and **conceptual frameworks** I developed or contributed to across academia and research institutions.  
It serves as a structured overview of my approach to **data analysis**, **modeling**, and **scientific reproducibility**, rather than a source code archive.

> 🧩 Each folder corresponds to a specific research phase (CRCT, CONICET, ENS) and contains Markdown files summarizing the objectives, methods, and results of individual projects.

## 🧭 Research Focus

- **Bioinformatics & Data Analysis**
  - RNA-seq (bulk & single-cell), deconvolution, and gene regulatory inference  
  - Network medicine and multi-omics data integration  
  - Statistical modeling and visualization of biological data  

- **Modeling & Systems Biology**
  - Agent-based modeling of tumor–immune ecosystems  
  - Multi-scale simulations of cellular dynamics (NetLogo, OpenMOLE)  
  - Network perturbation and system-level functional analysis  

- **Molecular & Structural Biology**
  - Protein evolution and structural modularity  
  - Regulatory mechanisms in transcription and post-transcriptional control  

- **Scientific Communication & Pedagogy**
