# **Nina Verstraete - Scientific Portfolio**

This repository serves as the entry point to my scientific and computational work in:

* computational biology & structural bioinformatics
* large-scale data processing and analysis
* pipeline design and refactoring
* scientific modelling 
* reproducible codebases

It is organized into two sections: my **CV** and a selection of **computational projects** that represent my experience.

---

## **1. CV — Scientific Background & Research Experience**

See folder here: [CV](CV)

This folder contains a curated overview of my scientific career, including:

* Research experience (computational biology, structural bioinformatics, multi-omics analysis, agent-based modelling)
* Postdoctoral and PhD
* Selected publications
* Scientific summaries used in job applications and dossiers
* Figure excerpts and high-level project descriptions

This section provides **context**, **trajectory**, and **scope** for the computational projects showcased below.

## **2. Bioinfo_projects - Featured Computational Biology Pipelines**

See folder: [bioinfo_projects](bioinfo_projects).

This directory highlights **five major projects**, presented as an independent module with its own README, analysis pipeline, figures, and code.

### **Included projects**

* **Ankyrin Structure** — structural determinants of repeat protein stability
* **Ankyrin Modularity** — evolutionary modularity and domain architecture
* **PaxDB Proteome Analysis** — amino-acid usage and metabolic constraints
* **CLL–NLC Agent-Based Model** — OpenMOLE-NetLogo–Python multiobjective calibration
* **Virus Interactome** — network analysis and multilayer reconstruction

Each project is structured for **reproducible research**:
