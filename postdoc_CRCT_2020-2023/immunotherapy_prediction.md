## 🧭 Context
Despite major clinical advances, only a fraction of cancer patients respond to immunotherapy.  
The GEMDECAN project aimed to identify gene expression signatures predictive of therapeutic response by integrating bulk RNA-seq data with clinical outcomes and molecular features across cancer types.

The goal was to define reproducible biomarkers guiding patient stratification for immune checkpoint therapies.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a standardized analysis pipeline for RNA-seq data from tumor samples.  
- Identify and validate gene signatures correlated with immunotherapy response.  
- Explore functional categories and immune-related pathways underlying predictive features.  

---

## 🧪 Methods
- **Data:** Bulk RNA-seq datasets from public repositories (TCGA, ICGC, clinical cohorts).  
- **Pipeline design:** Quality control (FastQC, MultiQC), alignment (STAR), quantification (featureCounts), normalization and batch correction.  
- **Analysis:** Differential expression (DESeq2), gene set enrichment, correlation with clinical response scores.  
- **Modeling:** Machine learning approaches (lasso regression, random forest) for predictive feature selection.  
- **Visualization:** Volcano plots, ROC curves, heatmaps of signature genes.
