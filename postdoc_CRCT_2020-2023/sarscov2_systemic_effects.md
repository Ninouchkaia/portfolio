## 🧭 Context
SARS-CoV-2 infection perturbs multiple cellular processes beyond its primary respiratory targets.  
This collaborative project investigated the **system-wide impact** of viral proteins on host molecular networks to understand how infection reshapes fundamental biological functions.

The study combined **virus–host interactomics**, **transcriptomics**, and **functional enrichment** analyses to delineate the molecular footprint of COVID-19 at the cellular level.

## 🧪 Methods
- **Data integration:** Protein–protein interaction data from mass spectrometry and curated databases.  
- **Functional enrichment:** Gene Ontology and Reactome analyses to map perturbed biological processes.  
- **Network analysis:** Graph-based propagation of perturbation scores across molecular interaction networks.  
- **Validation:** Comparison with transcriptomic responses from infected cell lines and tissues.
