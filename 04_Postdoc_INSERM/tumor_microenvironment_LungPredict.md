**Affiliation:** INSERM U1037 – Centre de Recherches en Cancérologie de Toulouse (CRCT)  
**Period:** 2020–2023  
**Project:** LungPredict – Transcriptomic Characterization of Lung Tumor Microenvironments  
**Note:** Analytical contribution not credited in final publication  

---

## 🧭 Context
The LungPredict project explored the heterogeneity of lung tumors by characterizing their **immune composition** and **regulatory activities** from bulk transcriptomic data.  
The goal was to uncover molecular features reflecting immune infiltration, stromal components, and potential therapeutic targets.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Deconvolute bulk RNA-seq profiles to estimate immune and stromal cell proportions.  
- Infer transcriptional activities of immune-related regulators and signaling pathways.  
- Correlate cellular composition with clinical and pathological parameters.  

---

## 🧪 Methods
- **Data sources:** Bulk RNA-seq datasets from lung adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma cohorts.  
- **Preprocessing:** Alignment, quantification, normalization, and QC of raw reads.  
- **Deconvolution:** Estimation of immune cell fractions using tools such as CIBERSORT, EPIC, and TIMER.  
- **Functional inference:** Pathway enrichment (GSEA) and regulatory activity prediction (DoRothEA, PROGENy).  
- **Integration:** Comparative analysis of immune subtypes and transcriptional programs across samples.  

---

## 💡 Contributions
- Processed bulk RNA-seq datasets and performed immune cell deconvolution analyses.  
- Estimated transcription factor and pathway activities from normalized expression matrices.  
- Supported result integration and visualization for internal reporting and consortium communication.  
- Helped interpret immune landscape variability in relation to tumor histology.
