## 🧭 Context
Macrophages in the tumor microenvironment can adopt pro- or anti-tumoral phenotypes depending on their molecular environment.  
In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a subset of macrophages, termed **nurse-like cells (NLCs)**, exhibit tumor-supportive properties that promote leukemic cell survival and immune escape.

This project investigated the regulatory mechanisms driving macrophage polarization in CLL through transcriptomic and network-based modeling approaches.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify transcriptional programs and regulatory genes associated with pro-tumoral macrophage polarization.  
- Integrate RNAseq-derived expression data with dynamic regulatory network models.  
- Explore signaling pathways influencing macrophage differentiation in the CLL microenvironment.

## 🧪 Methods
- **Data analysis:** Differential expression and pathway enrichment from bulk RNAseq of macrophage subtypes.  
- **Regulatory inference:** Identification of transcription factor activities using network-based approaches (VIPER / DoRothEA frameworks).  
- **Modeling:** Integration of regulatory signatures into Boolean or ODE-based network models representing differentiation trajectories.  
- **Validation:** Cross-comparison with published immune polarization datasets and experimental data from CLL samples.
